* Outline
/The idea is that I bastardize my previous paper, interweave my dev
notes as a narrative, make some proposals for using color, and
culminate in a conclusion about next steps./

** Problem 
/Expand active reading to include affect---instinctual and emotional
reactions to reading./

This project explores digital annotation as a way to make solitary
reading practices more embodied and engaging. I intend to modify an
existing annotation tool to use in my English 220: Introduction to
Writing about Literature course at Hunter College. As an instructor
for this course, I learned the difficulty of teaching active reading
skills in the classroom. By “active reading”, I mean strategies that
allow one to not only understand the ideas in a text, but to engage
critically with them. Often, active reading denotes a variety of
actions, such as highlighting, underlining, and writing in the margin,
to emphasize moments of interest that require close attention. These
strategies assist the reader to identify and focus on concrete
elements of the text and guide her in constructing a critical
response. However, as any English instructor of lower-level
undergraduate classes knows, these strategies do not come naturally to
most readers, and they have to be cultivated through repeated modeling
and practice in the classroom.  Instructors must make visible the
attention to language—specific sentences, phrases and words—required
in close reading, and demonstrate how to analyze language in depth,
particularly the elaboration of meaning or significance. From my
experience, I’ve found that using a digital annotation tool in the
classroom is immensely helpful for modeling “active reading”
strategies for students and following their progress as they complete
the reading. By annotating passages as a class, I can guide them
toward making incisive and thoughtful responses; and by having them
annotate the text as homework, I am able to see what my students are
thinking about, how they incorporated their knowledge of figurative
language that we learned in class, and how they work towards making
critical arguments about their reading.

While this tool has been immensely helpful for teaching close and
critical attention to language, I recently find myself more interested
in accessing and harnessing other kinds of responses to reading. For
this project, I will explore how this sense of “active reading” can be
expanded to include affect in order to engage nonverbal and embodied
responses to text. As Sharona Levy points out, it is very difficult to
understand how students process a text: “there is no mechanism to open
their heads and see which neurons are firing while they are reading”
(5).  Traditional annotation only engages critical activity in its
textual, verbalized form. Therefore, I propose to apply digital
annotation toward engaging nonverbal reactions to reading. While the
current tool allows me to make visible the role of analysis and
interpretation, and to follow my students’ progress in learning close
reading, it doesn’t address the emotional and instinctual reactions
that often occur in reading. An additional feature, specifically, the
option for color-coding the annotations, would allow students to
confront their more immediate responses, feelings, and gut reactions
during the reading process. By customizing the color of their
highlights, students may begin to understand how their feelings can be
part of a larger, more formalized analytical process. With more
options, students can identify moments of interest, confusion, or
other affects as moments that deserve further scrutiny. Additionally,
they can also use colors as flexible categories that indicate
different areas of understanding---such as figuration, themes, or
syntax. In this way, the tool will not only engage affect and bodily
reactions, but also allow for organizing and categorizing different
types of annotations.

** Guiding Questions
/The tension between the “provocative” and the “prescriptive”./
- First, how do traditional annotation tools and practices support a
prescriptive approach to teaching close reading: how do they create a
standardized method or process in responding to texts?  Quantify
everything movement, tracking students.
- Second, more specifically, do certain features, such as colors,
categories, or tags, for example, actually limit the kinds of
responses students might have without these prompts? In other words,
do these options actually create a structure that confines student
thinking? Usages of existing tools: ponder, lacuna, annotation studio.
- Third, from the opposite perspective, how can giving students
morenonverbal options in an annotation tool provoke them toward more
spontaneous insights?  Neuroscience and nonverbal options.

** Prescriptive Approaches: Standardization, Enabling/Disabling Constraints

*** Meeting notes: 

Michael:

Make my commit the best argument I can for why DH is an artist space.
- Scholarship as code
- Question: Currently we use different saturation values for our
  highlight color when selections overlap each other. How will we
  approach the overlapping of either completely different highlight
  colors? Is there a theory of color blending? (DWHALEY)

Writing the paper
- Think about where I can publish it. Hybrid pedagogy?
- Find a way to bring in my development notes as a narrative of my
  work.
- Think about how the story ends: accepted or rejected? Using it in a
class? Scholarship as code? Accepted or rejected? What is the promise
of queer DH?

Color
- My values / saturations are off.
- Read up on Color Theory. What are some color meanings?
- What are the right colors? What do they mean?
- Imagine what colors I would use to annotate a Woolf text
