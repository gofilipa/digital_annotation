* Outline
/The idea is that I bastardize my previous paper, interweave my dev notes as a narrative, make some proposals for using color, and
culminate in a conclusion about next steps./

** Problem 
/Expand active reading to include affect---instinctual and emotional
reactions to reading./

This project explores digital annotation as a way to make solitary
reading practices more embodied and engaging. I intend to modify an
existing annotation tool to use in my English 220: Introduction to
Writing about Literature course at Hunter College. As an instructor
for this course, I learned the difficulty of teaching active reading
skills in the classroom. By “active reading”, I mean strategies that
allow one to not only understand the ideas in a text, but to engage
critically with them. Often, active reading denotes a variety of
actions, such as highlighting, underlining, and writing in the margin,
to emphasize moments of interest that require close attention. These
strategies assist the reader to identify and focus on concrete
elements of the text and guide her in constructing a critical
response. However, as any English instructor of lower-level
undergraduate classes knows, these strategies do not come naturally to
most readers, and they have to be cultivated through repeated modeling
and practice in the classroom.  Instructors must make visible the
attention to language—specific sentences, phrases and words—required
in close reading, and demonstrate how to analyze language in depth,
particularly the elaboration of meaning or significance. From my
experience, I’ve found that using a digital annotation tool in the
classroom is immensely helpful for modeling “active reading”
strategies for students and following their progress as they complete
the reading. By annotating passages as a class, I can guide them
toward making incisive and thoughtful responses; and by having them
annotate the text as homework, I am able to see what my students are
thinking about, how they incorporated their knowledge of figurative
language that we learned in class, and how they work towards making
critical arguments about their reading.

While this tool has been immensely helpful for teaching close and
critical attention to language, I recently find myself more interested
in accessing and harnessing other kinds of responses to reading. For
this project, I will explore how this sense of “active reading” can be
expanded to include affect in order to engage nonverbal and embodied
responses to text. As Sharona Levy points out, it is very difficult to
understand how students process a text: “there is no mechanism to open
their heads and see which neurons are firing while they are reading”
(5).  Traditional annotation only engages critical activity in its
textual, verbalized form. Therefore, I propose to apply digital
annotation toward engaging nonverbal reactions to reading. While the
current tool allows me to make visible the role of analysis and
interpretation, and to follow my students’ progress in learning close
reading, it doesn’t address the emotional and instinctual reactions
that often occur in reading. An additional feature, specifically, the
option for color-coding the annotations, would allow students to
confront their more immediate responses, feelings, and gut reactions
during the reading process. By customizing the color of their
highlights, students may begin to understand how their feelings can be
part of a larger, more formalized analytical process. With more
options, students can identify moments of interest, confusion, or
other affects as moments that deserve further scrutiny. Additionally,
they can also use colors as flexible categories that indicate
different areas of understanding---such as figuration, themes, or
syntax. In this way, the tool will not only engage affect and bodily
reactions, but also allow for organizing and categorizing different
types of annotations.

*** What is Hypothesis?

Hypothes.is is an open source annotation tool that operates as a
browser extension, which means that it can be activated and used on
any page that appears on a web browser. To use Hypothes.is, the user
must first create an account on the Hypothes.is homepage. Then, they
have to download a browser extension and activate it. After activating
the browser extension and logging into the account, they are able to
make annotations. To make an annotation, users highlight the desired
text and type their comment in a simple text box that appears. After
saving their comment, the original text is highlighted, and all users
may view the annotation on a collapsible sidebar. By selecting the
“reply” button, users then can respond to the comment, which will
appear below the previous annotation on the sidebar. My proposal would
modify the appearance of the highligther by offering options for
highlighter colors. Rather than just have yellow, users can choose
among a variety of colors to highlight the text. As an open-source
project, with extensive documentation and a supportive developer
community, Hypothes.is, will be the base for developing my
customizations.

** Guiding Questions
/The tension between the “provocative” and the “prescriptive”./

In developing the tool, I wonder how annotation might expand or reduce
the quality of the student’s engagement with the text. Here, I’m
concerned in the tension between what I call the
“provocative”---opening up the text to new insights---and the
“prescriptive”---limiting a student’s interaction with the text to a
predetermined set of choices or options for responding. In exploring
this tension, I have three main questions: First, how do annotation
tools support a prescriptive approach to teaching close reading: how
do they create a standardized method or process in responding to
texts? Second, more specifically, do certain features, such as colors,
categories, or tags, for example, actually limit the kinds of
responses they could have without these prompts? Do these options
actually create a confining structure? And finally, from the opposite
perspective, how can giving students more nonverbal options in an
annotation tool provoke them toward more spontaneous insights?


/First, existing tools & prescriptive approach to teaching close reading, Quantify everything movement, tracking students./ 

This color-coding feature aims to resist the pervasive and insidious
nature of many “edtech” tools and platforms, especially those that
quantify or “measure” student learning. The effects of edtech range
from exploitative to harmful, as Audrey Watters explains in her
extensive investigations on dangers of collecting information on
students, which not only makes them vulnerable to those who would
profit from them economically, but also reduces them data points and
labels, such as “cheat” or “at risk”. In “ Ed-Tech and Trump ”,
Watters explains that the desire to track and collect student data is
closely associated with the desire to harm certain demographics, as
was the case with the first computational census that began in Nazi
Germany.  More recently, in a talk at the Graduate Center, Watters
discusses how certain edtech tools that track student
performance---and purport to create “personalized” learning
experiences---actually work to standardize and automate
education. Keeping these conversations in mind, I’m interested in
creating a tool that resists this trend of quantification. Therefore,
by experimenting with nonverbal, embodied reactions to reading, I hope
to achieve two things: first, as stated above, I hope to examine the
role of affect in critical thinking, and second, I hope to explore how
“tracking” can serve ends that are not exploitative, but provocative
and empowering. Through this tool, I will experiment with active
reading and assessment that engages moments of emotional struggle and
insight, rather than measurable “learning outcomes”.

/Second, how features limit the kinds of responses, creates structure that confines student thinking? Usages of existing tools: ponder, lacuna, annotation studio./

The project most relevant to my proposal is a tool called “Ponder”,
created by a private tech company, Parlor Labs, Inc.  Like
Hypothes.is, Ponder is a browser add-on tool that can be activated on
any webpage. The company describes it as a “micro-response tool”, that
purports to “give teachers a view into the ‘invisible’ process of
learning through higher-order critical thinking” (“About”). The tool
shares a basic functionality with Hypothes.is, which is highlighting
text and responding through a written annotation. But has some
additional features, including options for different “reactions”,
called “sentiment tags”, and options for choosing from a list of
“themes”, compiled and customized by the teacher. The “sentiment tags”
are particularly interesting, because they allow students to
categorize and color-code their responses according to
“clarification”, “analysis” or “emotion”. Unfortunately, the project
is proprietary, and charges a fee for its full usage.

Another example of digital annotation comes from a project called
“Lacuna Stories”, developed by the Poetic Media Lab at Stanford
University, where it is incorporated as a Learning Management
System. One major difference with Lacuna Stories its use as a
platform, rather than a tool, for social reading and writing. Lacuna
Stories is meant to be used by schools as a central organizing space
for a course, like Blackboard or Canvas and provides a reading and
writing interface for engaging with course materials. That being said,
the annotation component here functions similarly to Ponder: the
reader highlights a section of the text, and has the option of making
a comment. Then, the reader will be prompted by options for different
types of responses. Like Ponder, there are four categories, which are
also color-coded: “Comment”, “Question”, “Analyze”, and
“Connect”. However, unlike Ponder, Lacuna Stories contains a tracking
mechanism for teachers to follow their students’ progress as they
complete the homework and make annotations. On the “Annotations
Dashboard”, which is only visible to the course instructor, student
data such as the number of annotations, length of annotation, and
private/public status of annotations is visible to the teacher in a
series of graphs and charts. In the section, “Filter by Time”,
instructors can view the raw number of annotations made on any given
day of the course, which can be useful to get an overall sense of
daily participation. In “Annotation Details”, a series of pie charts
indicate the relative amount of annotations by category (“comment”,
“question”, “analyze”, connect), the length for each annotation, and
the ratio of shared to private. Here, I wonder at the purpose of
tracking the length of each annotation, and how such metrics might
prioritize quantity as an assessment criterion. Finally, the “Network”
section connects students to the texts they have annotated, with the
links between them weighted (thickened) according to the amount of
annotations each student made on each text. This section allows
instructors to see how many annotations each text received by each
students. As a review of Lacuna Stories in The Journal of Interactive
Technology and Pedagogy notes, “social annotations can serve as an
accountability mechanism for completing assigned reading in a timely
fashion, because instructors will see students’ activity on the text
and students will know that instructors can see this activity.” This
feature of the dashboard allows teachers to track the quantity, rather
than the quality, of student annotations. For this reason, it promotes
what Watters and Abreu describe as the reductive effects of certain
edtech tools. There is another platform, Annotation Studio , that also
follows and analyzes a student’s progress through the text through
visualization methods. Again, at what point does the implementation of
these tools actually reduce or flatten the critical interventions that
they are supposed to inspire?

** Prescriptive Approaches: Standardization, Enabling/Disabling Constraints
/How do traditional annotation tools and practices support a
prescriptive approach to teaching close reading: how do they create a
standardized method or process in responding to texts? Audrey Watters,
Amelia Abreau: tracking students, quantifying affect./ /Do certain
features, such as colors, categories, or tags, for example, actually
limit the kinds of responses students might have without these
prompts? In other words, do these options actually create a structure
that confines student thinking? Usages of Ponder, Lacuna, Annotation
Studio./

** Cyborgs, Neuroscience, and Nonverbal Options

/- N. Katherine Hayles: marking embodied/affective knowledge vs discursive/ 

I am influenced by the work of N. Katherine Hayles, John Bean, and
Amelia Abeau. These theorists’ work, which range across the subjects
of cybernetics, college composition, and theories of the quantified
self, situates my thinking on the role of affect in technology and in
writing. Hayles, in How We Became Posthuman has been a continued
influence in how I think through human interaction with machines,
particularly on the tension between embodied and disembodied
knowledge. Hayles’ book examines the question, “How we became
posthuman” by examining “how information lost it’s body” (2). By this
phrase, Hayles means the idea, descendant from eighteenth century
liberal humanism, that knowledge and feelings can exist independently
of the body. She examines philosophical trends that prioritize
rationality in the human, and extend into conceptions of the
posthuman, which imagines the body as a prosthesis of the mind. In
thinking about Hayles’ work, I’m specifically interested in how
annotation engages with reading as an embodied practice that engages
with extra-textual meaning . In other words, how can annotation
connect more directly to knowledge as feeling and affect, rather than
knowledge as information that exists purely in a textual form?

John Bean’s work also influences how I approach affect as part of an
analytical process.  Bean’s book, Engaging Ideas , explores how
college composition and rhetoric instructors can use writing as a
method to teach critical thinking skills in the classroom. Bean argues
that the act of writing is implicitly analytical and evaluative,
rather than communicative. He suggests instructors organize their
lessons around “problems”, specifically, “beautiful problems… [which]
create natural critical learning environments” (3). He explains that
good writing assignments provoke a kind of productive discomfort, and
that academic writing ought to capitalize on this “intellectual and
often emotional struggle” (23). According to Bean, this struggle
emerges with the awareness that a problem exists, which students must
attempt to resolve. I’m interested in exploring how “beautiful
problems” create moments of insight and spontaneous response.
Throughout his work, I’m most influenced by power that “wonder”,
“discomfort” and “struggle” have in stimulating thinking. But unlike
Bean, I dwell on the power of these affects prior to their
verbalization in traditional composition practices.

** Color Theory toward a Queer Theory
/Prescribed or spontaneous?/ /Plutchik’s wheel of emotions, Trans colors/ 

One of the challenges in developing the tool will be to think through
the affordances of using color in pre-defined ways and using it more
spontaneously.

*** Meeting notes: 

Michael:

Make my commit the best argument I can for why DH is an artist space.
- Scholarship as code
- Question: Currently we use different saturation values for our
  highlight color when selections overlap each other. How will we
  approach the overlapping of either completely different highlight
  colors? Is there a theory of color blending? (DWHALEY)

Writing the paper
- Think about where I can publish it. Hybrid pedagogy?
- Find a way to bring in my development notes as a narrative of my
  work.
- Think about how the story ends: accepted or rejected? Using it in a
class? Scholarship as code? Accepted or rejected? What is the promise
of queer DH?

Color
- My values / saturations are off.
- Read up on Color Theory. What are some color meanings?
- What are the right colors? What do they mean?
- Imagine what colors I would use to annotate a Woolf text
