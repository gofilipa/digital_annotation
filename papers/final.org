* Misfittings: Social Annotation with Colors

start with the problem statement: edtech tends on a trend toward
quantification, toward reduction. /There has been no mechanism for
opening up our students' heads/. Then include quote about what's
happening in china, then go into the dangers of edtech including the
reductions of emotional data.

only then, start to introduce my tool, and the goal of expanding
active reading to include affect. then, partition & explanation of dev
notes.

aft3r intro...

the first half of the paper will be looking at different edtech tools
for how they encourage prescriptive reading practices.

the second half will be discussing how my tool projects to work in
social contexts to facilitate "misreadings".

** Intro 

*** Seeing Neurons
In a discussion about using digital annotation tools to teach critical
reading and writing, Sharona Levy explains that current technology can
only go so far in illuminating how students process what they
read. She encouraged her students to comment on texts, to make their
understanding more transparent and explicit. Although digital
annotation tools facilitate active reading practices, Levy points out
that "there is no mechanism to open [our student's] heads and see
which neurons are firing while they are reading" (5). In the 10 years
that Levy ran her annotation experiments, however, educational
technology has developed more incisive and sophisticated methods for
visualizing student performance. Just a few months ago, primary
schools in China are rolling out a "smart learning" program, where
teachers track student learning through headbands that report on brain
activity. The headbands are programmed to sense fluctuations of brain
activity across different parts of the brain in class. They report
these levels, which appears to correlate to student focus during a
lesson. The results are then visualized and projected for the whole
class to see:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The competition plays out in the form of a simulated rocket race on a
screen at the front of the classroom. The headwear measures electric
signals from neurons in the brain and translates that into an
attention score using an algorithm. The more focused a student is, the
higher the score gets, and the higher his or her rocket flies. If the
score falls—meaning the student’s attention is waning—the rocket
slows. Wang et al, "China’s Efforts"
#+END_QUOTE

Developments of "smart learning" in China are part of a general
increase in surveillance technology, such as facial recognition
technology. Although these developments are more pervasive and
advanced in China than in the US (at least for the time being),
China's example suggests a trajectory for Educational Technology
(EdTech). These tools, which track and visualize student performance,
ultimately aim for mass neuronal surveillance.

*** EdTech: Tracking Learning 

In the US, EdTech blazes the trail toward tracking and
quantification. Educational platforms and tools increasingly offer
"personalized solutions" for educators to measure and optimize student
learning. In doing so, these technologies treat students as a site for
data collection and analytics. Not only does tracking students make
them vulnerable to those who would profit from them economically, it
also reduces them to data points and labels, such as “cheat” or “at
risk," according to Audrey Watters ("Ed Tech and Trump"). Watters
explains that data collection and analytics simplifies the differences
among learners and the complexity of the learning process. Learning
then becomes less about cultivating individual critical thinking
skills and more about acclimating students to certain mechanized
processes for response and information retrieval. Watters concludes
that, in purporting to create “personalized” learning experience,
these programs actually standardize and automate education. Like
Watters, Amelia Abreu is wary of the capitalist aims that drive
quantification, and she explores the role of emotion in
quantification. Abreau focuses on the "Quantified Self" movement,
which encourages followers to track and measure daily activities, such
as exercise and work, toward "the discovery and adoption of
near-perfect, near-universal metrics" ("Quantify
Everthing"). Quantified Self aims for this ideal measurement of the
human body and human actions in order to improve them, making them
more efficient and productive. Abreu points out that the drive toward
human optimization, which "has been problematized since Rousseau,"
leaves out emotional or affective qualities that are more challenging
to quantify. How do these tools measure the struggle that students
undergo in solving a problem? The feelings of confusion, doubt,
interest, and elation that accompany learning? The danger here, which
Abreu points out, is that these emotional qualities and labors are not
easily sensed or represented by quantitative methods.

*** Affect to Elude Traking

One example of this difficulty is in edtech solutions for Digital
Annotation, often used to teach "active reading" skills in English
classrooms. In English instruction, Digital Annotation makes reading
practices more visible in order to improve critical thinking and
literary analytical skills. It allows students to highlight and
comment on electronic text, which can then be viewed and responded to
by other students. Most implementations of Digital Annotation aim to
cultivate active reading practices that engage directly with the ideas
and language of the text, which are difficult to teach except by
modeling and practice, as many English instructors know. Even this
elusive work of active reading is not immune to the attempts of
tracking and standardization. A variety of recent digital annotation
tools now extend the basic "highlight" and "comment" functionality to
offer additional options for responding, such as categorizing types of
annotations, as well as tracking student reactions to reading. Some of
these tools, which I explore in detail below, quantify and visualize
student annotations to make assessment easier for instructors. In
doing so, they run the risk of reducing the emotional labors of
reading to artibrary metrics like "annotation length." How might
digital annotation address /affect/ as part of active reading
processes? How can instructors short circuit attempts at tracking to
address more directly the emotional and instinctual reactions that
occur during reading?

My project explores how digital annotation can side-step attempts at
tracking by offering alternatives to verbalized response. It seeks to
activate reading as an embodied practice, connecting more directly to
knowledge as feeling and affect, rather than knowledge as information
that exists purely in a textual form. Toward that end, I've modified
my /Hypothes.is/[fn:1] annotation tool to include a multi-color
highlighter, rather than just yellow. The option for multiple colors,
I hope, will recuperate the role of the body in reading in ways that
resist quantification and tracking, by prompting reactions that occur
prior to fully articulated thought. In prioritizing nonverbal or
preverbal responses, it recasts reading as an embodied activity,
encouraging students to confront their more immediate responses,
feelings, and gut reactions during the reading process.

*** TODO link the idea of verbalization and tracking? 
could this be about alternative methods of visualizing student
performance, perhaps in ways that elude traditional quantification?

*** partition, structure to come

Though things are developing dramatically in the world of EdTech,
Levy's claim---that you cannot open up a student's brain to see which
neurons are firing during reading---still stands. Although we cannot
(yet) visualize how a student processes a text, looking at what
happens in the brain and body during reading reveals the role of
affect in opening up how we understand learning. By "affect," I refer
to the cogntive and embodied processes of perception that guide
emotional reactions to text. In reading the body back into active
reading, Digital Annotation becomes the site where conversations about
educational technology intersect with conversations about theories of
embodied cognition. Therefore, for the rest of this paper, I approach
educational technology side by side with discussions on embodied
cognition, searching for parallels across the technical and
neurological. Exploring how emotion functions in the body enhances my
critique of the pedagogical value of certain annotation tools and
offers alternative methods for assessing student performance. As the
example with China's "smart learning" headbands demonstrates, if we do
not engage thoughtfully with the processes of embodied learning,
EdTech will provide its own "solutions."

Throughout my examination of technology and embodiment, I also
interweave a narrative of my work on the annotation tool that I'm
developing for my English classroom. Here, I insert excerpts and
images from my "development notes," a record of my progress throughout
the tool's technical and theoretical development. These notes portray
the confusion, contradictions, and suspensions of knoweldge that are
part of working with technology. I hope that these notes will show
readers who are not familiar with coding that, regardless of
proficiency, all technological projects contain obstacles and
challenges. By making the coding work more visible, I gesture toward
the inherent opacity of digital methods and tools, indicating to the
nontechnical reader some of the suspensions of knowledge that are part
of immersing yourself within a technical project.

*** Dev Environment

3.1.19: Day One at the New Media Lab.

Today Joe and I tried following the Client development instructions on
the H docs. There were a bunch of issues, mostly to do with NPM. From
what I can gather, Node requires you to install it globally, rather
than just locally. As a result, every time we ran the local version of
NPM we encountered a bunch of errors.

It took us (mostly Joe) about an hour and a half attempting to install
the client and browser-extension this sloooow way before we finally
doubled back and started over with a non-problematic installation of
node. This involved deleting the repos from Github and starting over,
installing the dependencies (node) via the NVM (node version manager)
rather than NPM. The instructions are below:

** Edtech

*** Anger Avoids Exploitation

The attempts by EdTech to turn human bodies into sites of data
collection benefit from a general disagreement about how learning
works in the brain and body. Neuroscientists have long argued about
seemingly simple questions like where consciousness is located, not to
mention how learning functions on a neuronal level. This uncertainty
leaves a space for cognition to be coopted into discourses about
productivity and management. For example, Catherine Malabou points out
the common assumption in "neuronal ideology" that brains should be
made to conform and adapt to social and economic needs. Malabou finds
a troubling parallel between discourses on "brain plasticity," which
posit a flexible, developing brain, and capital's need for docile,
networked, and adaptable workers. In resisting this understanding of
"brain plasticity," she explores another valence of the word plastic
that is based off the french term /plastique/, meaning "explosive."
Rather than approach plastic as flexible, something that can be molded
to fit economic needs, plastic can be an agent for annihiliation and
creativity. Plasticity in this sense offers a means of refusal to
submit to the managerial model, to resist complicity to
capitalism. Malabou insists that affect---particularly anger---is a
tool for refusing expectations for docility and complicity: "Perhaps
we ought to relearn how to enrage ourselves, to explode against a
certain culture of docility, of amenity, of the effacement of all
conflict even as we live in a state of permanent war" (79). Her
exhortation to "enrage" ourselves points to a way that people can use
emotion to subvert pressures to be managed or conform to standards of
productivity.

*** Tool overview: the “provocative” vs “prescriptive”.

Malabou's invocation to anger as a means of resisting the pressures of
productivity opens up the way we understand digital annotation. How
can tracking student reading can serve ends that are not exploitative,
but creative, approaching students as sites of data production rather
than data collection? In what follows, I examine a variety of Digital
Annotation tools (alongside my own) for how they scaffold student
responses to reading. Here, I'm interested in whether Digital
Annotation facilitates what I call prescriptive or provocative
approaches to reading. Prescriptive approaches encourage a
standardized method for responding to text, where certain options
preempt or prompt students to react in specific ways. Provocative
approaches open the text up to new insights, bringing students to
imagine new relations and reactions to what they read. How do certain
features, such as color-coding, categories, or tags, for example,
actually create a confining structure for response? Do additional
options limit the kinds of responses students might have without these
prompts? Specifically, I wonder how such features might engage
emotional struggle and insight, rather than measurable “learning
outcomes.”

*** adder.html 
5.2.19: adder.html

This is the short html file for the buttons, both the "Annotate" and
"Highlight" button that pop up together once you make a text
selection./ /I am able to make additional buttons (which don't
actually work when pressed) on the toolbar by duplicating the html
within the file. It is important to note that on its own, my work in
this file doesn't affect functionality. In order for the buttons to
work, I have to modify some javascript files that save and pass the
data from the user’s click.

The image shows two files on top of each other. In the background,
there’s an image of my final modifications to the adder, with an
additional drop down menu for colors under the “Highlight” button. In
the foreground, there’s an image of the original HTML file that
configured the adder.

*** Ponder

[[file:itp_final_images/ponder.png][ponder response options]]

The annotation tool most compelling for my puposes is “Ponder”,
created by a private tech company, Parlor Labs. Like Hypothes.is,
Ponder is a browser add-on tool that can be activated on any
webpage. The company describes it as a “micro-response tool”, that
purports to “give teachers a view into the ‘invisible’ process of
learning through higher-order critical thinking” (“About”). The tool
shares a basic functionality with Hypothes.is, which is highlighting
text and responding through a written annotation. But it has some
additional features, including options for different “reactions”,
called “sentiment tags”, and options for choosing from a list of
“themes," compiled and customized by the teacher. The “sentiment tags”
are particularly interesting, because they allow students to
color-code their responses according to the categories
“clarification," "analysis" or "emotion." Carl Byth explains that goal
of this "microresponse" strategy is to condense student responses into
a simple expression that others can most easily engage with:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To encourage students to “read each other,” Ponder limits responses to
short phrases called sentiments that fall into three categories:
comments about text comprehension (e.g., “I don’t get this”),
critiques of the text (e.g., “This smells like hyperbole”), and
emotional responses to the text (e.g., “Tsk, I disapprove.”) Blyth 209
#+END_QUOTE

These pithy annotations enourage readers to categorize their responses
as cognitive, analytic, or emotional, and they allow interpretations
to be shared and recognized among readers. These “microresponses”
function analagously to emoticons or emojis, which are more
exaggerated methods of condensing feeling into a expression that’s
easily shared across social media.

Despite the obvious social benefits of this tool, this prefabrication
of responses could be constraining. By forcing the reader to choose
between “clarification”, “analysis” or “emotion”, is the tool
determining what kind of reaction someone might have? Or do these
three tagging options function as an “enabling constraint”, that is,
as a productive scaffolding that guides students toward thinking more
deeply about their reading? Keeping these questions in mind, I now
turn to another tool that functions similarly to Ponder.

*** Lacuna Stories

This other example of digital annotation comes from a project called
“Lacuna Stories," developed by the Poetic Media Lab at Stanford, where
it is deployed as a Learning Management System. As such, it is used by
schools as a central organizing space for a course, like Blackboard or
Canvas, and provides a reading and writing interface for engaging with
course materials. To make an annotation, the reader highlights a
section of the text, and has the option of making a comment. Then, the
reader is prompted by options for different types of responses. Like
Ponder, there are pre-set categories for responding, which are also
color-coded: here, the categories are “Comment”, “Question”,
“Analyze”, “Connect”. According to Stanford instructors Amir Eshel and
Brian Johnsrud, one of the tool’s main benefits is how it visualizes
their students' solitary responses to reading in a way that directs
classroom discussion about the text.

[[file:itp_final_images/lacuna.png][lacuna stories interface]]

*** Annotation Dashboard

[[file:itp_final_images/lacuna_dash.png][lacuna stories instructor dashboard]]

Despite the benefits, there are drawbacks that come with increased
access to student annotations. Making annotations visible necessarily
prescribes certain patterns of response and textual interpretations
over others. The instructors admit that Lacuna creates a trade-off
between what they call "guidance and discovery," that is, "a tension
that must be negotiated between the desire to allow students the space
for intellectual discovery and the desire to guide their learning
along a pre-specified path” (“Making Reading Visible”). In other
words, annotation primes students toward more fixed interpretations of
the text before they even enter into the classroom.

Another drawback is the way that Lacuna Stories tracks and visualizes
student activity across the platform. Lacuna contains an “Annotation
Dashboard” that is only visible to instructors so that they might
access data about their students' annotations. On this dashboard,
student data such as the number and length of annotations is
quantified and visualized in a series of graphs and charts. Here,
annotations "serve as an accountability mechanism for completing
assigned reading in a timely fashion, because instructors will see
students’ activity on the text and students will know that instructors
can see this activity” (Schneider et al). For example, in “Filter by
Time," instructors can view the raw number of annotations made on any
given day of the course, getting a sense of individual
participation. In “Annotation Details”, a series of pie charts
indicate the relative amount of annotations by category and the length
for each annotation. Finally, the “Network” section connects students
to the texts they have annotated, where the links between them are
weighted according to the amount of annotations each student made on
each text. By directly visualizing quantitative information about
student annotations, the Annotation Dashboard potentially engages in
the reductive effects of certain edtech tools that Audrey Watters
warns about. How is tracking the distribution, amount, of length of
annotations an effective assessment criterion?

*** Styling the Dropdown IV:

July 17, 2019: Label-less Icons

After much difficulty, I've decided to forgo the color labels on the
drop down, and have the highlighter icon on its own, in the relevant
color. When playing around with different sizes for the icon, its
simiplicity started to appeal to me. This decision also accords with
what I've said before regarding Jon Udell's script to "tag"
annotations with color. My project is moving away from using verbal
cues and engaging in verbal reactions. So having the color itself be
the selection on the interface makes sense, because the person engages
directly with that color.

The problem is that coloring the icons proved extremely time
consuming. I wanted each icon to display the color indicated in the
colors label. First, I spent a lot of time trying to find the source
of the icon to change the color, ended up going on icomoon, where I
still couldn't figure out how to do it. I also tried a bunch of
different CSS solutions, coloring the h-icon-highlight image to red,
for example. This worked, but it made all the icons red. There's no
way for me to do this just to one icon. I finally ended up by using in
inline CSS rule in adder.html to color the entire button. This is less
elegant than I hoped, but at this point I need to move on. I'm going
to leave it as is and start thinking about functionality.

busy style]] [[file:itp_final_images/dropdown3.png][the third iteration: simple colored icons]]

*** Quantifying Tension

However, there is a way that the tool uses quantified data in order to
address reading experiences that cannot be quantified. The
visualization of heavily annotated areas of text in the “Network”
panel allows the instructors to identify moments of collective
interest within annotations, and turn them back into sites of
affect. The instructors explain that, “By using Lacuna as a window
into students’ reading, [we] were able to pinpoint the exact places in
the text that generated the most frustration, confusion, or
disagreement [among] students” (“Making Reading Visible”). Here, the
threaded annotations, where students engage in debate and conversation
about the text, serve as an indicator of tension in their reading,
creating a "heatmap" of the text's more controversial
moments. Instructors can then turn the class’s attention to exploring
these moments more fully.


** Layering Emotions
*** Layering Colors / misfittings

Identifying moments of tension is one of the goals of my multi-color
highlighter. This highlighter contains a degree of opacity, which can
be adjusted manually by going into the code. In making the colors
almost transparent, one color can be layered over another, creating
color mixtures and combinations. Low opacities of primary colors, when
used among a group of readers, create a visible palimpsest of
readings.

[image of orlando in multiple colors]

This effect evokes conversations in neuroscience about the ways that
embodied cognition works (or fails to work) within social
contexts. Although much of neuroscientific work on "embodied
cognition" does a good job situating thinking in the body, it tends to
overlook how body specificity determines individual
experience. According to Victoria Pitts-Taylor, much of this work
assumes universal brain structures across all populations. In
response, Pitts-Taylor explores how brains are shaped by real
inequalities of race, gender, class, and sexuality, asserting that
“bodily difference yields cognitive difference” (56). She gives the
example of "mirror neurons," which are neurons in the brain which
activate when the body engages in or witnesses action, and are thought
to enable empathy. "Mirroring" whatever action they perceive, these
neurons enact the same process in the brain as if the body were really
performing the action. According to Pitts-Taylor, neuronal simulation
can actually get in the way of understanding. Bodily difference will
cause mirror neurons to make mistakes, projecting one set of
assumptions onto another body. She explains that “We cannot rely on
simulation, whether propositional or neural, to do the work of knowing
the other and of relating to them and feeling for them in nonviolent
ways” (92). My tool aims to reveal this limit of identification
through the layering feature. It is my hope that alternative reactions
to a particular text will render in the color mixtures, in the alchemy
of dissonances, combinations, and new concoctions that layering
creates.

*** Tracing the Click

8.8.19: Tracing the Click

I spent some time trying to understand exactly what happens in the
code when a user makes a text selection. But, since it's so complex, I
had to break it up. I outlined the parts of the code relevant to
highlighting, which Joe pointed out to me. I was able to get a better
sense of how the highlighting is processed here, through specific
functions and calls. Things really started to come together when I
followed the code backward, starting from the end, and working my way
up to the event handler in adder.js. Overview of events: The
onHighlight option called in addder.js initiates a call to
createHighlight which passes "true" for highlight into a larger
function called createAnnotation. It's in this function that
highlightRange runs with potentially three arguments, which I can
configure in index.coffee. Joe suggested that I pass a CSS class into
this function as a third argument, which specifies the color of the
highlight. That's it!

[IMAGE: Tracing the click]

*** Damasio: Embodied Cognition

This tool approaches affect as a type of knowledge that extends into
the body, and configures the user interface to engage bodily
experience. The process of embodied cognition---how thinking happens
with the body---is therefore a crucial consideration to my
project. Antonio Damasio, a vocal proponent for embodied
consciousness, explains that consciousness arises from emotions in the
body of the organism, which are experienced as "somatic markers" such
as rapid heartbeat or nausea, for example. These emotive experiences
in the body float then up to an organism's awareness, whereby rapid
heartbeat might be noticed as anxiety, and nausea as disgust. Damasio
makes this key distinction between emotion as a bodily experience and
feeling as mental awareness:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Emotions are complex, largely automated programs of /actions/
concocted by evolution. The actions are complemented by a /cognitive/
program that includes certain ideas and modes of cognition, but the
world of emotions is largely one of actions carried out in our bodies,
from facial expressions and postures to changes in viscera and
internal milieu. Feelings of emotion, on the other hand, are composite
/perceptions/ of what happens in our body and mind when we are
emoting. As far as the body is concerned, feelings are images of
actions rather than actions themselves; the world of feelings is one
of perceptions executed in brain maps. 116-117
#+END_QUOTE

By the time a person is aware of a feeling, it has already released an
emoting cascade in the body. According to Damasio, our feelings are
often vague because their stimulation often incorporates internal,
largely unconscious sensations---or "primordial feelings"---as part of
the emoting cascade (108). I intend for my tool to engage the
vagueness of embodied feelings through the hapic experience of using
the computer interface. My idea is that the user's activity of making
a text selection and choosing colors will create a rhythm of response
that might harness immediate and primordial feelings that occur during
the reading process.

*** index.coffee

8.30.19 it works!

Last week, I had a meeting with Joe and we were able to iron out the
remaining issue of calling the highlight value from the button to
configure the highlight color. Basically, we passed the highlight data
through guest.coffee into the highlighter module, in index.coffee,
where we added a script that configures the appropriate color
depending on which button was clicked.

[IMAGE: index.coffee]

*** How I Use Color: Engaging Emotions

I experiment with color opacity is by having color mixtures indicate
emotions. Below is a “wheel of emotions” developed by Robert Plutchik,
a professor of psychology, who transposes his own theory of emotions
into a color wheel. In this image, the color differences indicate
changes in emotional quality and saturation indicates the intensity of
emotion. The more saturated colors on the inner ring represent more
intense forms of the emotion, while the brighter colors on the outer
rings are milder. There are eight primary emotions, which run along
the second ring: these are joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness,
disgust, anger and anticipation. For example, apprehension (light
green) is a mild form of fear, while rage (dark red) is an intense
form of anger. Plutchik also theorized emotional dyads, which are
feelings composed of two emotions. The dyad between fear and surprise
is awe, and between joy and trust is love.

What if students use these colors not only to highlight text according
to their feelings or gut reactions, but also to engage with other
students’ highlights in the form of layering? I wonder what would
happen, for example, if one student were to highlight a piece of text
as orange, for “anticipation”, and another were to highlight that same
piece as red, for “anger”. The resulting dyad, which would be
red-orange, signifies “aggressiveness” on the chart. How does this
result change the way we read the text? My sense is that confronting
and attending to these feelings will open up ways that students
connect to what they read.

/This is as much as I have for now... I need to add sections that
expand on Pitts-Taylor's discussion on mirror neurons to talk about
"misfitting" and connection to Disability studies, include some color
theory (the choice of color palettes and whether or not color use
should be used in pre-defined ways or more spontaneously), and, of
course, my experience of using this in the classroom <--- most
important/



** To Write: Color Theory toward a Queer Theory
*** Prescribed or spontaneous colors?
image: https://mymodernmet.com/color-mixing-chart/

One of the challenges in developing the tool will be to think through
the affordances of using color in pre-defined ways and using it more
spontaneously.

Another will be to think through the choice of color palettes. Now, I
have chosen primary colors of red-blue-yellow, with low opacities, to
facilitate color layerings and the engendering of new colors. But
there are other options for colors.

What if I chose color schemes that have other significations? For
example, the Trans flag, which comes in pink, blue, and white. How
would such a color scheme affect reading?

[image of trans flag].

What about other schemes, collections of triadic colors?

- Think about where I can publish it. Hybrid pedagogy?
- Find a way to bring in my development notes as a narrative of my
  work.
- Think about how the story ends: accepted or rejected? Using it in a
class? Scholarship as code? Accepted or rejected? What is the promise
of queer DH?

Color
- My values / saturations are off.
- Read up on Color Theory. What are some color meanings?
- What are the right colors? What do they mean?
- Imagine what colors I would use to annotate a Woolf text

The emphasis here on frustration and confusion enacts something
analogous to John Bean’s strategy of posing “beautiful problems” to
guide class writing and discussion. Bean suggests instructors organize
their lessons around “problems”, specifically, “beautiful problems…
[which] create natural critical learning environments” (3). He
explains that good writing assignments provoke a kind of productive
discomfort, and that academic writing ought to capitalize on this
“intellectual and often emotional struggle” (23). According to Bean,
this struggle emerges with the awareness that a problem exists, which
students must attempt to resolve. I’m interested in exploring how
“beautiful problems” create moments of insight and spontaneous
response.  Throughout his work, I’m most influenced by power that
“wonder”, “discomfort” and “struggle” have in stimulating
thinking. But unlike Bean, I dwell on the power of these affects prior
to their verbalization in traditional composition practices
