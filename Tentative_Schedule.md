The Independent Study work (to be completed during Spring of 2019) is divided into four stages, *Building*, *Breaking*, *Sharing*, with a preliminary set-up stage. Below is a brief and tentative sketch of the schedule.

### January
This is a preliminary period during which I will do research on the Hypothes.is codebase and set up my development environment to make changes to Hyp.

### February
This is the *Building* phase, during which I will create the MVP (Minimal Viable Product). My goal is to create single change to Hyp that adds multicolor functionality to the highlighter tool. During this time, I will focus solely on the Hyp codebase, and aim for my specific objective. This month will be relatively unstructured building work, because I cannot anticipate the obstacles that are sure to arise. I may have to spend some weeks brushing up on coding languages if needed.

### March

The *Breaking* phase is an opportunity for me to push the boundaries of whatever I have accomplished during the *Building* phase. This is an opportunity to combine theory with practice, as I will be re-considering some of my *Guiding Questions* from my [Proposal Summary](/proposal_summary.md):
* First, how do traditional annotation tools and practices support a prescriptive approach to teaching close reading: how do they create a standardized method or process in responding to texts?
* Second, more specifically, do certain features, such as colors, categories, or tags, for example, actually limit the kinds of responses students might have without these prompts? In other words, do these options actually create a structure that confines student thinking?
* Third, from the opposite perspective, how can giving students more nonverbal options in an annotation tool provoke them toward more spontaneous insights?

To answer these questions, I will examine in depth the existing annotation tools listed in the "Environmental Scan" section of the Summary. These tools include **Ponder**, [**Lacuna Stories**](https://github.com/PoeticMediaLab/Lacuna), and [**Annotation Studio**](https://github.com/hyperstudio/Annotation-Studio), to which I will add the foundational [**Annotator.js**](https://github.com/openannotation). For these projects, I will look at case studies (academic research) and the codebase. The main goal during this phase is to understand how I can further enhance, trouble, or contextualize the work I've done during the *Building* phase.

### April

This is the *Sharing* phrase, the last step of the project. Here, I will try to push my changes to the Hyp master project, or find my own way of distributing the work, including essays or talks. The main goal is to plan ways to publicize and share what I have learned with the academic community.
