# Digital Annotation

Welcome to the repo for my Digital Annoation project! Here I'm going to document my progress as I develop the project.

In brief, the project consists of developing an annotation tool (ideally, from [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/)) to include multiple color functionality for the highlighter. I am choosing hypothes.is because of its sophistication and popularity, and I've had positive experiences using it as an instructor in my own classroom. I hope that adding multiple colors to the highlighter tool will encourage students to engage with affects and other nonverbalized feelings and reactions to reading.

See my [Proposal Summary](proposal_summary.md) for a condensed and updated version of the proposal paper that I wrote for my Interactive Technology and Pedagogy class in Spring 2018. There, you will see my problem statement, proposal, critical engagements, guiding questions, and tentative plan to complete the project. 

To get a sense of my progress and plans, you might check out the [project schedule](schedule.md) for a timeline of the work to be carried out developing this project through Spring 2019.

If you're interested in more detailed documentation about my project status, I keep a record of my development notes [here](notes/development_notes.md), which I update weekly. To see my theoretical development on this project, browse through the [papers](/papers) folder, which contains my coursework and feedback during my Interactive Technology and Pedagogy class in the Spring of 2018, as well as more recent conference paper, presented in March 2019. To be clear, this work presents quite a range of my thinking, from my preliminary view of my project over a year ago to more recent speculations on where color annotation might take me.
