# Digital Annotation

Welcome to the repo for my Digital Annoation project! Here I'm gonig to document my progress as I develop the project.

In brief, the project consists of developing an annotation tool (from [hypothe.is](https://web.hypothes.is/)to include multiple colors functionality for the highlighter. I hope that such a feature will encourage students to engage with affect and other nonverbalized feelings and reactions to reading.

See my "Proposal Summary" for a condensed version of the proposal paper I wrote for my Interactive Technology and Pedagogy class in Spring 2018. There, you will see my problem statement, proposal, critical engagements (with citations), guiding questions, and tentative plan to complete the project.
