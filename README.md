# Digital Annotation

Welcome to the repo for my Digital Annoation project! Here I'm going to document my progress as I develop the project.

In brief, the project consists of developing an annotation tool (from [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/)) to include multiple colors functionality for the highlighter. I hope that such a feature will encourage students to engage with affect and other nonverbalized feelings and reactions to reading.

See "[Proposal Summary](/proposal_summary.md)" for a condensed version of the proposal paper I wrote for my Interactive Technology and Pedagogy class in Spring 2018. There, you will see my problem statement, proposal, critical engagements (with citations), guiding questions, and tentative plan to complete the project.

See the folder "[ITP_PapersAndFeedback](/ITP_PapersAndFeedback)" for my coursework completed (as well as feedback) during my Interactive Technology and Pedagogy II class in the Spring of 2018.
