# Digital Annotation

Welcome to the repo for my Digital Annoation project! Here I'm going to document my progress as I develop the project.

In brief, the project consists of developing an annotation tool (ideally, from [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/)) to include multiple color functionality for the highlighter. I am choosing hypothes.is because of its sophistication and popularity, and I've had positive experiences using it as an instructor in my own classroom. I hope that adding multiple colors to the highlighter tool will encourage students to engage with affects and other nonverbalized feelings and reactions to reading.

See "[Proposal Summary](/proposal_summary.md)" for a condensed version of the proposal paper I wrote for my Interactive Technology and Pedagogy class in Spring 2018. There, you will see my problem statement, proposal, critical engagements, guiding questions, and tentative plan to complete the project.

See the folder "[ITP papers and feedback](/ITP_PapersAndFeedback)" for my coursework completed (as well as feedback) during my Interactive Technology and Pedagogy II class in the Spring of 2018. This work presents a very preliminary view of my project, and doesn't reflect my development since the Spring of 2018.

Finally, see the [Tentative Scheule](Tentative_Schedule.md) for a timeline of the work to be carried out developing this project through Spring 2019.
