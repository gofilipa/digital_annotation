The Independent Study work (to be completed during Spring of 2019) is divided into four stages, **Building**, **Breaking**, **Sharing**, with a preliminary reach out and set up stage. Below is a brief and tentative sketch of the schedule.

### December 2018

This is the **Preliminary Period** during which I will reach out to folks at Hypothes.is and Github contributors. The goal is to alert them to my project ideas and ask for input or suggestions/preferences, if they have any.

Besides making contact with these folks, I will do research on the Hypothes.is codebase and set up my development environment to make changes. I may also have to spend some weeks brushing up on coding languages / UI design as needed.

### February-March 2019

This is the **Building** phase, during which I will create the MVP (Minimal Viable Product). My goal is to implement a single change to H that adds multicolor functionality to the highlighter tool. During this time, I will focus solely on the H codebase, and aim for my specific objective. This month will be somewhat unstructured, because I cannot anticipate the obstacles that are sure to arise. 

In this phase, I tackle the work according to three separate "problems":
- *the UI problem*---what does the element look like, where is it called throughout the code?
- *the API problem*---how do I get this command (probably ajax) into the API, formatted and streamlined?
- *the Database problem*---where is it stored?

### April 2019

The **Breaking** phase is an opportunity for me to push the boundaries of whatever I have accomplished during the *Building* phase. Here I will focus on two goals: responding to contributor requests on Github, and engaging my current work with my original theoretical frame. 

Specifically, I will explore some of my *Guiding Questions* from my [Proposal Summary](/proposal_summary.md), in an attempt to combine theory with practice:
* First, how do traditional annotation tools and practices support a prescriptive approach to teaching close reading: how do they create a standardized method or process in responding to texts?
* Second, more specifically, do certain features, such as colors, categories, or tags, for example, actually limit the kinds of responses students might have without these prompts? In other words, do these options actually create a structure that confines student thinking?
* Third, from the opposite perspective, how can giving students more nonverbal options in an annotation tool provoke them toward more spontaneous insights?

To answer these questions, I will examine in depth the existing annotation tools listed in the "Environmental Scan" section of the Summary. These tools include [*Ponder*](https://www.ponder.co/welcome/), [*Lacuna Stories*](https://github.com/PoeticMediaLab/Lacuna), and [*Annotation Studio*](https://github.com/hyperstudio/Annotation-Studio), to which I will add the foundational [*Annotator.js*](https://github.com/openannotation). For these projects, I will look at case studies (academic research) and the codebase. The main goal during this phase is to understand how I can further enhance, trouble, or contextualize the work I've accomplished during the *Building* phase.

### May 2019

This is the **Sharing** phrase, the last step of the project. Here, I will try to push my changes to the H master project, or find my own way of distributing the work, including essays or talks. (I'm already slotted to give a talk at the [Northeast Modern Language Association Conference](https://www.buffalo.edu/nemla/convention.html) in Washington DC in late March.) The main goal is to plan further ways to publicize and share what I have learned with the academic community.
